    "The file contains names of reviewers and their reviews of different restaurants in the comma separated format. The first string is the name of the reviewer followed by a name of a restaurant and its rating. You are required to write a Python program that computes a similarity score between any two reviewers using Euclidean distances. An example data from the restaurant_reviews.txt file is given below: \n",

    "Solution / Read me:\n",
    "1. Program begins by prompting user for file to read, exception for file not found handled.\n",
    "2. Upon right fill name, file is read and split based on comma delimiter, used a temporary dictionary to store each comma delimited values by running through a loop and finally assigining reviewers name as key and the values from the temp dictionary as values. \n",
    "4. User is prompted between 3 choices (1,2,3) \n",
    "5. On selecting 1, User can enter two reviewers name to be compared, exception for invalid names handled. \n",
    "6. Since reviewer name is key in dicitionary, it has to be exactly as it is stored in dictionary. \n",
    "7. Temporary dictionary of the two name from user is created where restaraunt name and rating is stored as key value pair\n",
    "8. A list of common restaurant name (key) is obtained and the euclidean score is calculated for all the matching keys.\n",
    "9. Score is shown with 4 decimal value\n",
    "10. On selecting 2, User enter 1 reviewers name to be compared and scored against all other reviwers(key) in the database. \n",
    "11. Similar logic is followed for finding the common rated restaraunt. \n",
    "12. loop is maintained for computing the comparative scores between user choice of reviwer and all others in database.\n",
    "13. A key of \"\\n\" is stored and results in a unique key-value pair in the main dictionary and yields a result of 0.0 in the last row. "
